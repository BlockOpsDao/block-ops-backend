# What is a contract?

A contract should be created by a User by using the block-ops website. The contract should have specified requirements to be satisfied by the resulting code a developer submits. 

Should we build a tool that allows Users to submit a final test, or in the Machine Learning use case a final testing dataset? 

We could build an SDK to standardize model packages for the ML use case.

We could simply allow Developers to submit their artifacts and some sort of passing tests with accuracy metrics. The User would then be responisble for making sure the artifacts actually satisfy their requirements. This means we would need to submit some sort of Escrowing system where the User would post the bounty amount plus an additional security deposit fee. After the User approves a contribution and declares it as the winner, the bounty amount is sent to the Developer and the security deposit is returned to the User. 

As an alternative to the Escrowing system, we could require that Users stake a certain amount of a token on our platform then build out logic to punish Users who do not pay their Developers.
